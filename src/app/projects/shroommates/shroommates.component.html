        Shroommates was a light-hearted 3D platforming adventure where players solve puzzles through clever use of the environment 
        and try to get everyone back home safely. The player is a little shroom in a big worldâ€”squish down for a powerful jump, parachute 
        away with the mushroom cap, and climb vines to get to vantage points around the house. Beware of the human chef bent on putting 
        delicious shrooms on his pizza, and a deadly Shroomba that attacks fungi on sight!

                Project was developed in Unreal Engine 4. Programming responsibilities ranged over different tasks such as implementing 
                the upgrade system, in-game store, interactable items, environmental hazards, player locomotion, and various other 
                player mechanics using a combination of C++ and blueprints. Constantly communicating with the designers was a crucial 
                component of development to make sure the mechanics I implemented matched their designs and I exposed specific 
                functions/variables in blueprints to make sure the designers could fine tune the mechanic without having to go into code.
